  ///
  /// If [allow] is false, then the result will be "Int* the W**ds".
  /// Every matching sequence is replaced, and each "o" matches the

  ///
  /// If the pattern was the [RegExp] `o+`, the result would be the

  /// [allow] is false, the result would be "Int* the W*ds" (with the
  /// two "o"s replaced by a single occurrence of the replacement
  /// string) because both of the "o"s would be matched simultaneously
  /// by the pattern.
  ///
  /// Additionally, each segment of the string before, during, and
  /// after the current selection in the [TextEditingValue] is handled
  /// separately. This means that, in the case of the "Into the Woods"
  /// example above, if the selection ended between the two "o"s in
  /// "Woods", even if the pattern was `RegExp('o+')`, the result
  /// would be "Int* the W**ds", since the two "o"s would be handled
